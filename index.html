<ul> 10 oz Ground Pork
2 cloves Garlic
1 Tbsp Tuscan Spice Blend

<p> Steps </p>
<li> Prepare ingredients. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water and boil on high. Wash and dry fresh produce. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic, thinly slice scallions and seperate white bottoms from green tops, and cut off and discard the stems of peppers. Halve peppers lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. </li>
In a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add pork, 1/4 Tbsp od spice blend, and as much red pepper flakes as you like. Cook, stirring frequently and breaking meat apart with a spoon until lightly browned (About 3-4 minutes). </li>
Add chopped garlic, sliced with bottoms of scallions, and sliced peppers. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened (About 3-4 minutes). </li>
Add tomato paste to the pan. Cook, stirring constantly for 30 seconds to a minute, until thoroughly combined.</li>
Add 1/2 cup of water. Season with salt and pepper and cook until sauce is slightly thickened (About 2-3 minutes). Turn off heat. </li>
Meanwhile, add the gnocchi to the pot of boiling water. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the gnocchi float to the top of the pot. Reserve 1/2 cup of the gnocci cooking water. Drain and return to pot. </li>
Add cooked pork and sauce to cooked gnocchi and half of reserved gnocchi cooking water. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes. </li>
Turn off heat, and stir in mascarpone and romesco sauce until thoroughly combined with gnocchi. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. </li>
Serve the finished gnocchi garnished with the sliced green tops of scallions and parmesan. </li>

<p> This particular recipe is one that I discovered when I received one of my weekly Blue Apron boxes, and was actually my introduction to cooking and eating gnocci. It's incredible, the gnocci are like pillowy noodles made from potatoes but doesn't taste like mashed potatoes by any means. Those mixed with a spicy, creamy tomato sauce is truly an experience that I feel everyone must try.</p>
