<br>Steps<br>
<pr>Prepare ingredients. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water and boil on high. Wash and dry fresh produce. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic, thinly slice scallions and seperate white bottoms from green tops, and cut off and discard the stems of peppers. Halve peppers lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise.</pr>
<pr>In a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add pork, 1/4 Tbsp od spice blend, and as much red pepper flakes as you like. Cook, stirring frequently and breaking meat apart with a spoon until lightly browned (About 3-4 minutes)</pr>
<pr>Add chopped garlic, sliced with bottoms of scallions, and sliced peppers. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened (About 3-4 minutes)</pr>
<pr>Add tomato paste to the pan. Cook, stirring constantly for 30 seconds to a minute, until thoroughly combined.</pr>
<pr>Add 1/2 cup of water. Season with salt and pepper and cook until sauce is slightly thickened (About 2-3 minutes). Turn off heat.</pr>
<pr>Meanwhile, add the gnocchi to the pot of boiling water. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the gnocchi float to the top of the pot. Reserve 1/2 cup of the gnocci cooking water. Drain and return to pot.</pr>
<pr>Add cooked pork and sauce to cooked gnocchi and half of reserved gnocchi cooking water. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes.</pr>
<pr>Turn off heat, and stir in mascarpone and romesco sauce until thoroughly combined with gnocchi. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired.</pr>
