<p> This particular recipe is one that I discovered when I received one of my weekly Blue Apron boxes, and was actually my introduction to cooking and eating gnocci. It's incredible, the gnocci are like pillowy noodles made from potatoes but doesn't taste like mashed potatoes by any means. Those mixed with a spicy, creamy tomato sauce is truly an experience that I feel everyone must try.</p>
